*My take on the basic skills you need to become a software engineer*

The internet is littered with posts on the skill set you need to get started with, or get better at, software engineering. In this post I set out my take on the subject. I will leave the typical software engineering / computer science curriculum topics out of scope (data structures, algorithms, program design, etc)[<sup>[1]</sup>][mattmight] and focus instead on the skills you need to take part in the day to day activities that take place in a development team.

## Workflow and roles


## Methodology
Most development teams have adopted some form of agile development. Therefore make sure you have digested the Agile manifesto[<sup>[2]</sup>][agilemanifesto] and also work through the Scrum guide[<sup>[3]</sup>][scrumguide]. In practice, you will find as many variations as there are projects. Try to get some experience with different ticketing systems that are often used for the administration of an agile project. JIRA by Atlassian is a well known product for this.

## DTAP + deployment
Development teams work with different environments to run their software artifacts, most often defined as Development, Test, Acceptance and Production. 

## Version control


## Coding standards


## Requirements gathering



## Testing


## Debugging

## Exception handling




# Adopt the open source philosophy, even in proprietary projects
You do not write code for yourself, and you hardly write it for a machine. You write to to exchange ideas with others (which may very well be your future self).

## Unix


## CI / CD





## Practices to become a valued member of any software development team

### Know the role that you play
Know what your responsibilities are, and especially what they are NOT. Reject any task and any target that is not a responsibility of your role. This sounds obvious and simple, but I assure you it is not. Many self help books describe this skill as knowing to say no. The other side of this balance is taking ownership of what IS your responsibility. Responsibility demands response when it comes knocking on your door. So be ready to pick up what is yours, and to send away what is not.

On a more practical level, learn the common ways that development teams are organized. Get a feel for how the standard roles map to your current situation. Study agile methodologies like scrum, lean and extreme programming and the more traditional approaches like waterfall and RUP.

### Accept a task only if it defines its conditions for completion
Volumes can been written, and have been written, on the subject of requirements engineering. As a beginning developer, keep it simple and demand that any task assigned to you defines when the task is finished. In the scum methodology this is called the Definition of Done.

### Learn the workflow of software development
On a very high level, new work is defined by a stakeholder and at some point assigned to you. After implementation the work is tested and accepted. Finally the work is released to the production environment where it will affect the activities of the users.

### Learn text editing
This may sound a bit strange for a beginner. Surely you know how to edit text. I know you do, but I am also sure that if this topic surprises you, then there is a world for you to discover. Text editors like VIM and Emacs can take you on a life-long journey of getting more effective at editing text. 

### Work through a programming book every once in a while
