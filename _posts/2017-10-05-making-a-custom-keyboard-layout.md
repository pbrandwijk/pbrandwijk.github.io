*For more comfortable typing I use the Dvorak keyboard layout instead of Qwerty. However, I also prefer to use the caps lock key, which I rarely use, as an extra back space key. And I move caps lock to Shift + Back space. In this post I explain how it is configured.*

## Preliminaries
I'm using Ubuntu 18.04 as my OS.

## Adding custom keyboard layout
The keyboard layouts of XKB are stored under the 'symbols' folder of `/usr/share/X11/xkb/`.

Add the following snippet to `/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/us` file below the "dvorak-intl" definition:
```
// Pieter Brandwijk: My own custom layout based on Dvorak international with dead keys.
partial alphanumeric_keys
    xkb_symbols "dvorak-intl-swap-caps" {

    include "us(dvorak-intl)"

    name[Group1]="English (Dvorak, intl. swap Caps Lock)";

    // Replace Caps_Lock with BackSpace
    key <CAPS> { [ BackSpace            ] };
};
```

After this, you have to add a variant for the us layout to `/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.xml` :
```xml
<variant>
  <configItem>
    <name>dvorak-intl-swap-caps</name>
    <description>English (Dvorak, intl. swap Caps Lock)</description>
  </configItem>
</variant>
```

Add this just below the variant with the description "English (Dvorak, intl., with dead keys)"

## Alternative with xmodmap
The method above works fine when you use the standard Gnome window manager for Ubuntu. I use the i3 tiling window manager, which somehow doesn't pick up my customization. This alternate does work with i3.

You can customize a predefined layout using `xmodmap`. Place the following script in `~/.Xmodmap`
```
keycode 66 = BackSpace
keycode 22 = BackSpace Caps_Lock
clear Lock
```

This script has to be run when your window manager starts up. For i3, add the following to your i3 config file (`~/.i3/config` or `~/.config/i3/config`):
```
# Apply my custom keyboard mappings
exec xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap
```

You can get a full list of all active keybindings with `xmodmap` too:
```console
$ xmodmap -pk   # Full list with hexadecimal codes
$ xmodmap -pke  # Shows the same mapping, but in the expression format
$ xmodmap -e "keycode 115 = Escape"  # Remap 115 to Escape for this session
```

## Additional commands

### Key events
Use the `xev` tool to check what key event is bound to a given key:
```console
$ xev -event keyboard
```

### Gnome Tweak tool
If you use Gnome, the Gnome tweak tool allows you to do configurations that you won't find in the standard settings.
```console
$ sudo apt install gnome-tweak-tool
$ gnome-tweaks
```

## Switching the keyboard layout on the commmand line
If your GUI has no option to switch keyboard layout, you can use the following to do it with the command line:
```console
$ setxkbmap -layout us -variant dvorak-intl-swap-caps
$ setxkbmap -layout us -variant dvorak-intl
$ setxkbmap -layout us -variant intl
```

Use the following to check which configuration you are currently using:

```console
$ setxkbmap -query
```
